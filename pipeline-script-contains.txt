pipeline-script will build image from dockerfile in the github repo and then push the image to aws ecr and then will deploy that image in container in aws ec2. both docker and jenkins are running in the same ec2. Every time when the new image is pushed in aws ecr, it will be pulled, and remove the already running container of that image in the aws ec2 and deploy the new container with new image on same port
